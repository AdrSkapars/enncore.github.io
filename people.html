		<p style="font-size:16px;"> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=pzCa2LQAAAAJ" target="_blank">Edoardo Manino (PDRA)</a> is a Research Associate in the Computer Science department of the University of Manchester. He is part of the EnnCore project and focuses on automated verification of neural network architectures. His background is in Bayesian machine learning, a topic he recently got awarded a PhD from the University of Southampton. His other research interests range from network science to algorithmic game theory and reinforcement learning.</p>

		<p style="font-size:16px;"><a href="https://ssvlab.github.io/lucasccordeiro/" target="_blank">Lucas Cordeiro (Principal Investigator)</a> is a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Manchester. He has implemented various tools that have been used to verify significant industrial programs written in Java, C/C++, and CUDA. Among those are ESBMC, an SMT-based model checker for C/C++/Qt and CUDA, and JBMC, an SAT-based model checker for Java bytecode. These tools have been applied to find real security vulnerabilities in large-scale software systems. He received the Distinguished Paper Awards at SAC'08, ICSE'11, and SBESC'15 for his contribution to the verification and synthesis of embedded systems. In the last nine years, he won 25 awards from international competitions on software verification and testing. Dr. Cordeiro's industrial research collaborators include ARM, Intel, Samsung, Nokia, and TP Vision. He has a proven track record of securing research funding from EPSRC, Samsung, Nokia Institute of Technology, CAPES, CNPq, FAPEAM, British Council, and Royal Society.</p>

		<p style="font-size:16px;"><a href="http://andrefreitas.org/" target="_blank">André Freitas (Co-Investigator)</a> is Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester, where he leads the AI Systems Lab. Dr. Freitas works at the interface between latent and explicit semantic representation and inference. His works are the state-of-the-art in contextual Open Information / Knowledge Graph Extraction, sentence splitting. Dr. Freitas has pioneered explainable reasoning approaches, which are also the state-of-the-art in the field. Dr. Freitas introduced explainability into Text Entailment, the use of hybrid distributional-symbolic representations for Natural Language Inference and semantic parsing over large and heterogeneous knowledge graphs. Dr. Freitas worked as a project coordinator (InnovateUK IAA BP, RS Explainable QA) and technical leader (H2020 SSIX, H2020 MARIO, FP7 SIFEM) in NLP projects.</p>

		<p style="font-size:16px;"><a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/mustafa.mustafa.html" target="_blank">Mustafa A. Mustafa (Co-Investigator)</a> is a Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Research Fellow in the Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester. He is a Co-I of a multi-disciplinary FWO-SBO project on secure and privacy-friendly energy trading, the SNIPPET project (S007619N), where he leads the work package for designing algorithms for secure and verifiable biding, billing and market/user/grid behavior modeling based on AI/ML algorithms. Over the past few years, Dr. Mustafa has worked on several multi-disciplinary projects, including Smart Grid Security (EPSRC and Toshiba TREL), SAGA (InnoEnergy) and DiskMan (imec). His work won awards and recognition, including Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Fellowship (University of Manchester, 2017), Best Student Video Award (IEEE SmartGridComm 2017), Best Paper Award (SECURWARE 2017) and shortlisted for Distinguished Achievement Award as Postgraduate Research Student of the Year (University of Manchester, 2015). He currently acts as an expert in the IEC/SYC/WG3 EC Smart Energy Roadmap.</p>

		<p style="font-size:16px;"><a href="https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/" target="_blank">Xiaowei Huang (Co-Investigator)</a> is Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Liverpool. Dr Huang is an international lead on the verification and testing of neural networks. His paper on safety verification has attracted 240+ citations. The new research direction started from this paper has attracted significant attention, e.g., deep learning expert Dr Ian Goodfellow wrote a blog post dedicated to discuss this direction and the paper. Additional to the verification approaches, Dr Huang is also leading on the testing of deep neural networks. His team is the first to propose the MC/DC variants of test coverage metrics for neural networks and a concolic (i.e., combination of concrete and symbolic execution) testing approach for neural networks. Dr Huang is the PI of two Dstl projects on Test Metrics for AI worth £426k, and is a co-I of one of the UK hubs of robotics and AI for extreme environments on Offshore Robotics for Certification of Asset, leading the research on the certification of deep learning.</p>
